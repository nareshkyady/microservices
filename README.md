goal v1.0: achieve a basic microservice implementation in spring boot application

catalogapi - spring boot application
  what is it?
   - a simple spring boot application 
   - exposes few rest urls for CRUD operations
      - create / update (/catalog/products)
      - read (/catalog/products and /catalog/products/{id})
      - delete(/catalog/products/{id})
   - server port 5000
   - uses dynamo db (connecting to aws)
   - uses maven (build automation tool)
   
   
   can i run this locally?
   - yes
   
   what do i need to run locally?
   - eclipse latest
   - java se 8
   
   technology stack learnt
   - spring boot and REST (files: java libraries)
   - maven (files: pom.xml)
   - aws dynamo db (nosql database table creation, updation)
   
   http url to access rest services
   - http://localhost:5000/catalog/products
   
# microservices part - 2
goal v2.0
achieve a basic microservice implementation in spring boot application 
    - more details of this, is in goal v1.0
goal v2.1
integrate with spring boot actuator and micrometer to send data to prometheus and use grafana to generate graphs.
why? 
- Yesterday, i read this in some blog (a microservice must support visibility and transparency, indicators of its own state  and of system state, in a single plan of glass experience. 
- The dropwizard metrics library is one of the more popular approaches to capturing application metrics (gauges, meters, histograms, and counters). 
- Spring boot's actuator module provides deep integration with the DropWizard Metrics library, and supports exposing health end points, environment information, endpoint mapping information, request logs, and more. 
- Time-series databases like Hazelcast, StatsD, Graphite, InfluxDB, and OpenTSDB support the visualization and processing of metrics. DropWizard metrics and SpringBoot actuator can transparently export collected metrics to these time-series databases.)

technology stack learnt
  - docker basics
  - prometheus
  - grafana
  - spring actuator and micrometer
  
  
  steps to start prometheus and grafana in docker container
  - step 1: install docker locally
  - step 2: run prometheus locally
    docker pull prom/prometheus (pulls docker image)
    docker run -d --name=prometheus -p 9090:9090 -v <path to prometheus.yml>:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus â€”config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
  (note: sample prometheus yml is committed in catalogapi project)
  (runs docker image on port 9090)
    docker container ls (lists docker containers, here each container has id, which can be used to stop and remove from container before you run it again)
    docker stop <id> (stop docker container)
    docker rm <id> (remove docker container)
    - step 3: run grafana locally (on port 3000)
      docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana

  check http urls now,
  - http://localhost:5000/actuator (spring boot actuator)
  - http://localhost:5000/actuator/prometheus (sprint boot micrometer supports prometheus to sending data)
  - http://localhost:9090/ (prometheus)
  - http://localhost:9090/targets (check prometheus targets)
  - http://localhost:3000/ (grafana) - 
    login(admin/admin)
    add datasource now with details
      name: catalogapi-prometheus
      url: http://192.168.1.181:9090
    add new dashboard
    add new metrics which pulls from prometheus
      example: system_cpu_usage
    


  notes 
    micrometer is a dimensional-first metrics collection facade whose aim is to allow you to time, count, and gauge your code with a vendor neutral API. Through classpath and configuration, you may select one or several monitoring systems to export your metrics data to. Think of it like SLF4J, but for metrics!
    prometheus iss used to record real-time metrics in a time series database (allowing for high dimensionality) built using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting.

  extras of catalogapi
  - in pom.xml, in dependencies, 2 entries below are used to send spring boot application data to prometheus and 
    io.micrometer, org.springframework.boot
